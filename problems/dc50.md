# Assignment: dc50 - A Simple Command-Line Calculator

## Problem:
In this assignment, you will implement a basic calculator program called `dc50` that performs arithmetic operations on two floating-point numbers. The calculator will support five operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulo (`%`).

Your program will take three command-line arguments: two numbers and an operator. The program will then perform the corresponding operation and print the result. If the result is an integer (e.g., `5.0`), it should be printed as an integer without a decimal point. Otherwise, it should be printed as a floating-point number with decimal places.

This problem is derived from an earlier cs50

## Task:
1. **Take three command-line arguments:**
   - The first argument will be a number.
   - The second argument will be another number.
   - The third argument will be an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).

2. **Perform the operation:**
   Based on the operator passed in, perform the correct operation between the two numbers. Note that:
   - For the modulo (`%`) operation, both numbers should be cast to integers.
   - Handle division carefully to ensure it works with floating-point numbers.

3. **Print the result appropriately:**
   - If the result is an integer, print it without a decimal point.
   - If the result is a floating-point number, print it with decimal places.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - If fewer than three arguments are provided, or if the third argument is not a valid operator, print a usage message: `Usage: ./dc50 number1 number2 operator`.
   - If division by zero is attempted, print an error message: `Cannot divide by zero.`

## Example Usage:
<pre>
  $ ./dc50 5 3 +
  8
  $ ./dc50 10.5 2 *
  21.000000
  $ ./dc50 10 3 %
  1
  $ ./dc50 7 0 /
  Cannot divide by zero.
</pre>

## Hints:
- You can use `atof` from the C standard library to convert command-line arguments to floating-point numbers. Look it up on [CS50's manual page](https://manual.cs50.io/).
- For comparing and printing results, you might find `math.h` useful for functions like `floor()`. You can also look up the function on [CS50's manual page](https://manual.cs50.io/).
- To check if the third argument is one of the supported operators, you can use a `switch` statement.

## Implementation Details:

1. **Command-Line Argument Parsing**:
   The program needs to retrieve three arguments from `argv`: two numbers and one operator.
   
2. **Performing Arithmetic**:
   The operator will determine which arithmetic operation to perform. Handle each operation using a `switch` statement for clarity if you know how switch statements work. If you don't know switch statements, use if/else statements.

3. **Formatting Output**:
   Use conditional logic to check if the result is an integer (i.e., no decimal part) and print it accordingly.

## How to Submit:

To complete this problem set:

1.	Implement the solution in a file called dc50.c.
2.	Make sure your program passes all the test cases provided.
3.	Test via `check50 slvusd/cs50/problems/dc50`
4.  Submit via `submit50 slvusd/cs50/problems/dc50`

## Additional Challenge:

For an extra challenge, modify your program to handle more complex inputs, such as multiple numbers and operations at once, using Reverse Polish Notation (postfix notation).
